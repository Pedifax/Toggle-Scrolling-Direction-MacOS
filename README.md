# Toggle-Scrolling-Direction-MacOS

### The mouse scrolling direction toggler application for Mac OS (Ventura)!

We love our Macbooks, and we love to use them no matter we have a mouse or not. However, it can be a painful process to open system preferences, find the "Mouse" tab, and toggle the "Natural scolling" checkbox. That's why we need this app made of simple applescript.
